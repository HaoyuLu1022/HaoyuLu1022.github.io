Thin, fragile local structures, and variable global morphologies, etc., of topological tubular structures like vessels and roads, lead to the difficulty of its accurate segmentation. This paper of DSCNet simultneously enhance its perception for such tubular structures in 3 stages: feature extraction, feature fusion, and loss constraint. 

This paper was accepted at ICCV 2023.

# Premise
Topological tubular structures share common features of thinness, sinuousness and small proportion of the image, and are thus challenging to segment. Notably, there are 2 factors contributing to such difficulty.

![Examples of tubular structures](/images/dsconv-1.png)

1. **Thin and fragile local structure.** As is illustrated above, such structures account for only a small proportion of the overall image, and are susceptible to interference from backgrounds.
2. **Complex and variable global morphology.** Morphological variations are observed in targets located in different regions, depending on the number of branches, the location of bifurcations, and the path length. The model is likely to overfit on these features, resulting in weak ability to generalize.

With the recent emergence and prevalence of large models for computer vision tasks (e.g., SAM), which have exhibited excellent performance in basic tasks like segmentation, it seems that there is graudally forming a paradigm: people tend to fine-tune such models to adapt to the specific downstream tasks. At this point, it is controversial whether specified models, in contrast to large, general ones, are still worthwhile to be designed.

From a personal perspective, I opine that models particularly designed and implemented for certain tasks are still worth much attention. Here are 2 reasons:

1. For complex tasks like tubular structure segmentation proposed in this paper, large models may have the potential to cover them, while it takes too much time and energy to be tuned for such tasks in most cases.
2. Most large models in NLP and CV currently lack convinvible interpretibility, which might be easier to endow in terms of small, specified models.

To sum, this work proposed a novel framework of knowledge fusion to address the difficulties of segmenting thin tubular structures. The specific contributions are three-fold:

1. A dynamic snake convolution was proposed to adaptively focus on the slender and tortuous local features and realize the accurate tubular structures segmentation on both 2D and 3D datasets.
2. A multi-perspective feature fusion strategy was proposed to supplement the attention to the vital features from multiple perspectives.
3. A topological continuity constraint loss function based on Persistent Homology was proposed, which better constrains the continuity of the segmentation.
