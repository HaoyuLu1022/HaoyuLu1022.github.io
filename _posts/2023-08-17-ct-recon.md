In the scenario of low-dose CT image reconstruction, supervised deep learning is widely adopted, which generally demands a dataset containing pairs of normal-dose and correspoding low-dose images and is therefore challenging in clinical situations. This paper proposed an unsupervised deep learning method to tackle this problem.

# Formulation

The image reconstruction problem can be formulated as an inverse problem

$$
y=Ax+n
$$

where 

* $A$ denotes the projection matrix of CT imaging
* $y$ denotes the available measurement
* $x$ denotes the image to be reconstructed
* $n$ denotes the measurement noise, often modeled by i.i.d. random variables

# Approach 
## Related Works
2 approaches to extend **unsupervised denoising network** to solve inverse problems

1. Treat inverse problems as a denoising process, which post-process reconstructed images
2. Use DIP, which typically implies that early stopping can be an effective technique for regularizing a denoising network

## In This Paper
Generally speaking, the proposed method is based on Bayesian inference, where the prior distribution of an image is re-parametrized by a DNN with random weights.

In Bayesian inference, there are 2 representative estimators

1. maximum a posterior (MAP) estimator
$$x_{\text{MAP}}=\arg\max\limits_x p(x|y)$$
2. MMSE estimator, a.k.a. conditional mean estimatorr
$$x_{\text{CM}}=\mathbb{E}_{(x|y)}(x|y)=\int x\cdot p(x|y)\mathrm{d}x$$

where

$$p(x|y)$$

denotes the posterior distribution of $x$ given the measurement $y$
