excerpt: 'This work introduces a multi-GPU-based list-mode fully quantitative Time-of-Flight (TOF) PET image reconstruction technique, named QUANTOF, that integrates all corrections during PET image iterative reconstruction on GPUs. Additionally, optimizations have been applied to the backprojection algorithm, resulting in a two-fold increase in speed compared to the pre-optimized version. Validation using experimental datasets from a Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner demonstrates that this technique significantly reduces reconstruction time costs while achieving exceptional quantitative accuracy.'
